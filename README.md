# PiBase

Welcome to PiBase OS, a small, custom bare-metal operating system built for the Raspberry Pi 4.
Simply copy the contents of the 'OS' directory onto your boot device and it should run out-of-the-box.

This project was originally created as part of my bachelor thesis. The goal was to build a minimal system suitable for electromagnetic fault-injection experiments, giving full control over hardware resources while keeping software overhead as low as possible.

PiBase OS is not meant to be a production-grade operating system. It lacks many safety, security, and robustness features that a real OS would require. It’s also my first GitHub project of this size, so you will probably find places where the code or design could be improved a lot. Still, I hope it can be useful, interesting, or inspiring for anyone exploring bare-metal programming on the Raspberry Pi.

Feel free to explore, learn from it, or build on it!
